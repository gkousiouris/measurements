The folder contains the data from the submitted publication "Exploring the cloud/edge space-time continuum execution of a FaaS E-health inference process across diverse clusters", submitted in HotCloudPerf 2023. The data consist of the raw measurements per request, as well as the concentrated outputs per experiment configuration

The raw data include the columns:
parentSampleTime	action	otherInfo	setRate	globalStartTime	duration	waitTime	initTime	start	end	memory	success	clientSample	Network Latency withou Init	UserSideDelay (calculated from raw)


The processed data include the columns:
setRate	globalStartTime	averageDuration	averageWaitTime	averageInitTime	achievedAverageRate	averageUserSideDelay	averageStartLatency	successPercentage	coldStarts	launchGeneratorDelay	stdDevDuration	stdDevWaitTime	stdDevInitTime	stdDevUserSideDelay	stdDevStartLatency	Network Latency

Times are in milliseconds while rates are in messages/minute.
